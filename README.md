# NFT preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [NFT preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U).
I worked really hard in order to finish this challenge

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML 5 Markup
- CSS
- CSS Pseudo classes
- CSS flex-box

### What I learned

While completeing this project i learnt how to use relationship selectors.
I used an immediate child selector in this css

```
.main-img:active .modal > .modal-img{
    background-image: url(images/icon-view.svg);
    background-size: cover;
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;
    margin: 100px auto 0px;
    display: block;
}
```

### Continued development

I will start focusing more on more pseudo class elements, in order to get better
